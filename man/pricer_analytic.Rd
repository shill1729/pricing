\description{
{Compute European option prices under three basic models: Black-Scholes,
Merton's jump diffusion, and a log-normal mixture.}
}
\details{
{The argument \code{model} must be a named list of
\itemize{
\item \code{name} either "gbm", "mixture", or "merton"
\item \code{param} the parameters defining the above model.}
For "gbm" and "merton", \code{param} should be a vector of the risk-free rate,
volatility, and the same with the mean rate of jumps and jump parameters. For
"mixture" it must be a matrix of probabilities, risk-neutral rate, and volatilities.}
